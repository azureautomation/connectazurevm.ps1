Connect-AzureVM.ps1
===================

            

Connect-AzureVM.ps1 takes a servicename, VM name, username, and password as arguments and starts an interactive remote PowerShell session with an Azure VM. This script requires that Azure PowerShell already be configured on your local machine. Run Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile
 and Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile to configure Azure PowerShell once it has been installed.

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
